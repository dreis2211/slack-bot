This example is a pretty slim one and disabling a bunch of common slack features to just have a plain GPT/openai-bot in the end.

The bot can be added as Slack app by anyone in the Slack workspace and can handle private messages. Additionally the bot can be invited to channels, but then it will answer any message, which might be unwanted by default.

When a message is sent to the bot, it will answer with a message generated by the OpenAI API in a new thread. All replies within the new thread will have the thread history in context so OpenAI is able to generate dresponses based on the whole context. In the end the flow is presst similar to Chat-GPT and the message is also generated with the stream API to get first result as fast as possible.

**Data privacy note:** by default every message and response (+some medadata like used model) are stored in the log file. This can be disabled by setting `logger.level` to `warning` in the config.
